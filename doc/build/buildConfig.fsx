(*
    This file handles the complete build process of RazorEngine

    The first step is handled in build.sh and build.cmd by bootstrapping a NuGet.exe and 
    executing NuGet to resolve all build dependencies (dependencies required for the build to work, for example FAKE)

    The secound step is executing this file which resolves all dependencies, builds the solution and executes all unit tests
