## Overview

IRC.NET is a complete IRC (Internet Relay Chat) client library for the .NET Framework. It aims to provide a complete and efficient implementation of the protocol as described in RFCs 1459 and 2812, as well as de-facto modern features of the protocol.

This project was formerly hosted on [Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/ircdotnet).

### Non-RFC Features

* Parsing of [ISUPPORT parameters](http://www.irc.org/tech_docs/draft-brocklesby-irc-isupport-03.txt). Interpretation of parameters is left to the user.
 
* [CTCP (Client-To-Client Protocol)](http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/rfc/ctcpspec.html) support. Most common commands are supported.

## Help

* Talk to us on our [IRC channel](irc://chat.freenode.net/##irc.net) (*##irc.net* on Freenode).

* If you have confirmed that the behaviour is unexpected, submit an [issue](https://github.com/ircdotnet/ircdotnet/issues) on GitHub.
